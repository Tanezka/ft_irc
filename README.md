# ft_irc - Internet Relay Chat Server

Welcome to **ft_irc**, a project where we built our own **IRC server** using **C++98**. This project will helped us understand **networking, sockets, and real-time communication** protocols.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- ðŸ–¥ **Multi-client handling**: Supports multiple concurrent connections.
- ðŸ”— **TCP/IP communication**: Works over IPv4/IPv6.
- ðŸ”‘ **Authentication system**: Clients must authenticate with a password.
- ðŸ“¢ **Channel management**: Join, leave, and moderate chat rooms.
- ðŸ›  **Operator commands**: Kick, invite, topic, and mode settings.

## ðŸ“œ Server Mechanics
1. **Client Authentication**
   - Users must provide a password to connect.
2. **Channel Operations**
   - Clients can join and leave channels.
   - Messages sent in a channel are relayed to all members.
3. **Operator Privileges**
   - `KICK`: Remove a user from a channel.
   - `INVITE`: Invite a user to a private channel.
   - `TOPIC`: Set or view the channel topic.
   - `MODE`: Modify channel settings (`i`, `t`, `k`, `o`, `l`).
4. **TCP Communication**
   - Handles socket connections with non-blocking I/O.
